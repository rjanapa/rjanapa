<b>URL Shortener</b><br>

Step 1:<br> 
Functional Req<br>
Given a long URL generate a short URL<br>
Given a short URL return long URL<br>
Generate custom URL<br>
TTL of Generated URL<br>
Analytics<br>

Design Constraints<br>
Number of URL generated per second<br>
Number of URL retrieved per second<br>
Size of Short URL. Assume 7 to start with.<br>
Characters in Short URL 0..9,a..z,A..Z<br>

Step 2: Define Microservices<br>

Step 3: Draw Logical Architecture<br>
Block Diagram for each Microservice<br>
Data/Logic flow between them<br>
Rules of Thumb: <br>
1. If high volume of data needs to be pushed in near real time between two Microservices, use Pub-Sub. Pub-Sub is a Microservice of its own.<br>
2. If data needs to be pulled from Server to Client, use REST API.<br>
3. If data transfer is offline use Batch ETL (Extract Transform Load) Job.<br>

Step 4: Deep dive into each Microservice at a time<br>
Each Microservice consists of one or more tiers<br>
App Server Tier - Application Logic<br>
Cache Server Tier - For high througput data access and in-memory compute<br>
Storage Server Tier - Data Persistence<br>

Step 4a<br>
For each microservice <br>
○ Identify Data Model (what data needs to be stored) to match the functional requirements<br>
○ Discuss how data will be stored in storage and cache tiers<br>
○ Propose APIs to match the functional requirements<br>
○ Propose workflow/algorithm for the the API in each tier<br>
○ Propose flow across tiers within the microservice<br>

Data Model<br>
Short URL/Unique Id, Long URL, TTL, Creation Time<br>
k: Short URL/unique id<br>
v: Long URL, TTL, Creation Time<br>

API<br> 
Similar to CRUD operations<br>
create(Long URL) -> create(v)<br>
read(Short URL) -> read(k)<br>
update(k,v)<br>
delete(k)<br>

How data will be stored in storage and cache tiers: HashMap<br>

create(Long URL)<br>
● Comes to App Tier<br>
● Send directly to Storage Tier<br>
● Generate unique id for long URL<br>
● Store unique id:long URL in Storage Tier<br>
● Store unique id:long URL in Cache Tier<br>
● Convert the unique id to a unique 7 character long string in the App Tier<br>

read(Short URL)<br>
● App Tier gets request<br>
● Converts Short URL back to unique id
● Sent to Cache Tier<br>
● Cache Tier checks hashmap and returns if there is cache hit<br>
● Whenever there is a cache miss, hit the backend database. Whenever this happens, update the cache and pass the new entry to all the cache replicas. Each replica can update its cache by adding the new entry.

Algorithm<br>
● Convert unique id to 7 character long string<br>
● 62 characters(0..9,a..z,A..Z), 7 positions = 62^7 = (2^6)^7 = 2^42 = (2^10)(2^10)(2^10)(2^10)(2^2) = 4 trillion<br>

Step 4b<br>
For each microservice, Check whether each tier needs to scale<br>
● Need to scale for storage (storage and cache tiers)<br>
● Need to scale for throughput (CPU/IO)<br>
● Need to scale for API parallelization<br>
● Need to remove hotspots<br>
● Availability and Geo-distribution<br>
● Solve algebraically first and then put numbers<br>

Storage<br>
Size of (k,v) pairs: A<br>
Number of lifetime (k,v) pairs: B<br>
Number of (k,v) pairs generated per sec: C<br>
Storage = A * B  or<br>
        = C * Number of seconds in say 2 years * B or<br>
        = C * TTL (in seconds) * B<br>
Cache = 20-30% of Storage
