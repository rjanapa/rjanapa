<b>Instagram</b><br>
Photo-sharing service that let users to upload photos to share with other users<br>
Instagram is a social networking service that enables its users to upload and share their photos and videos with other users. <br>
Instagram users can choose to share information either publicly or privately. <br>
Anything shared publicly can be seen by any other user, whereas privately shared content can only be accessed by the specified set of people. <br>
Instagram also enables its users to share through many other social networking platforms such as Facebook <br>
Design a simpler version of Instagram for this design problem, where a user can share photos and follow other users. <br>

The ‘News Feed’ for each user will consist of top photos of all the people the user follows<br>

Step 1: Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, Extended Requirements, Design Constraints

Step 2: Define Microservice

Step 3: Draw Logical Architecture: Block diagram for each Microservice, Data/Logic flow between them.

Step 4: Deep dive into each Microservice

Step 4a: For each Microservice – Data Model, How data is stored in Storage and Cache Tier, API, Workflow/Algorithm for API, Flow across Tiers

Step 4b: For each Microservice – check whether each tier needs to scale for storage, cache, throughput (CPU/IO), API parallelization, remove hotspots, Availability and Geo-Distribution

Step 4c: Draw a generic distributed architecture per tier
