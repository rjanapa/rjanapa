<b>System Design</b></br>

Step 1:  Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, Extended Requirements, Design Constraints

Step 2: Define Microservice

Step 3: Draw Logical Architecture: Block diagram for each Microservice, Data/Logic flow between them.

Step 4: Deep dive into each Microservice

Step 4a: For each Microservice – Data Model, How data is stored in Storage and Cache Tier, API, Workflow/Algorithm for API, Flow across Tiers

Step 4b: For each Microservice – check whether each tier needs to scale for storage, cache, throughput (CPU/IO), API parallelization, remove hotspots, Availability and Geo-Distribution

Step 4c: Draw a generic distributed architecture per tier
