<b>System Design</b></br>

Step 1:  Functional Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, Extended Requirements, Design Constraints

Step 2: Define Microservice

Step 3: Draw Logical Architecture: Block diagram for each Microservice, Data/Logic flow between them.

Step 4: Deep dive into each Microservice

Step 4a: For each Microservice – Data Model, How data is stored in Storage and Cache Tier, API, Workflow/Algorithm for API, Flow across Tiers

Step 4b: For each Microservice – check whether each tier needs to scale for storage, cache, throughput (CPU/IO), API parallelization, remove hotspots, Availability and Geo-Distribution

Step 4c: Draw a generic distributed architecture per tier

<b>Technical Product Management </b></br>

<b>Meeting Manager</b></br>

My capstone project is office productivity tool called Intelligent Meeting Manager that makes it easy to organize meetings with template to define meeting agenda, co-host, invitees, capture meeting minutes, record accompanying documentation, well defined outcomes and schedule follow up meetings. It will leverage plugins provided by popular collaborative tools such as Zoom, Teams, Slack, Box, Confluence etc. The user home page presents a dashboard of meetings where the employee is either an organizer or invitee and makes it easy for one to search meeting records.  

The tool will have analytics feature to report on # of meetings held in an organization, how many of those result in successful outcome, # of invitees, # of hours spent in meetings by employee by day, week, month, year etc. It can be rolled up to report on # of meeting hours for the entire organization. The tool will have Machine Learning component that will predict on attendees availability based on the role (participant, contributor, for information etc.) to predict on required attendees availability leading to higher chances of invitee attending the meeting. 

Meeting Manager is an office productivity tool that is one stop solution that can be used by employees of an organization to effectively manage office meetings with well-defined outcomes and next steps.
