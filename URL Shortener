Step 1: 
Functional Req
Given a long URL generate a short URL
Given a short URL return long URL
Generate custom URL
TTL of Generated URL
Analytics

Design Constraints
# of URL generated per second
# of URL retrieved per second
Size of Short URL. Assume 7 to start with.
Characters in Short URL 0..9,a..z,A..Z

Step 2: Define Microservices

Step 3: Draw Logical Architecture
Block Diagram for each Microservice
Data/Logic flow between them
Rules of Thumb: 
1. If high volume of data needs to be pushed in near real time between two Microservices, use Pub-Sub. Pub-Sub is a Microservice of its own.
2. If data needs to be pulled from Server to Client, use REST API.
3. If data transfer is offline use Batch ETL (Extract Transform Load) Job.

Step 4: Deep dive into each Microservice at a time
Each Microservice consists of one or more tiers
App Server Tier - Application Logic
Cache Server Tier - For high througput data access and in-memory compute
Storage Server Tier - Data Persistence
