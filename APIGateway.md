Case Study: 

There are two R&D Labs supporting two seperate API services. Create a Web based service that would interact with two API services, The API could be interfacing with two different h/w systems. This could be common set of services that would interface with two seperate API services,  There could be a Mobile App and a Web App interfacing with common set of interfaces. Create a project plan that would convey your thought process.

Approach:

Requirements Gathering
Technical Feasibility Study - Engage with Arch/Engg in Team A / Team B to understand impact to expose 
Road Map Planning - Product Iterations vs Timeline
High Level Solution Design
Funding/Resourcing Requirement
Risk Planning - Teams committments, release schedules, resource availability, a product that has never been done before - what are the possible areas of failure and what are the mitigation plans
Present the high level plan to Senior Leadership for thumbsup
Budget / Resource Approval
Low Level System Design Workshop
 Hire Squad to build Mobile App/Web App
PI Planning, Product Backlog, Sprint Planning, Spring Backlog - Engage Engineering in Team A , Team B to build, Hire squad to build common set of services to access susbsytems - API A and API B, Mobile App and Web App.
End to End Testing
Plan Go-Live
Post Production Support
User Training
Plan next iteration

Considerations:

What are the possible risks and what are the mitigation plans? 

A end to end system design has to take into account overall performance issues, defect resolution could be a challenge especially when a transaction involves two seperate system. Close colloboration and communication would be key to succcess for the delivery of end to end solution. The performance of the system depends on both the systems performing optimaly to meet SLAs. There is a risk with the overall product failing due to underlying systems expandibility to allow for future product requirments
