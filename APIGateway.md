Case Study: 

There are two R&D Labs supporting two seperate API services. Create a Web based service that would interact with two API services, The API could be interfacing with two different h/w systems. This could be common set of services that would interface with two seperate API services,  There could be a Mobile App and a Web App interfacing with common set of interfaces. Create a project plan that would convey your thought process.

Approach:

Intake Process
Engage with partenering team. Engage with Arch/Engg/Product Team in Team A/Team B to understand modification if any to expose API<br>
Requirements Gathering: Flush out Business and Technical Requirements  <br>
High Level System Design<br>
Business and Technical Feasibility Study<br>
Road Map Planning - Product Iterations vs Timeline (e.g. MVP) <br>
High Level Solution Design<br>
Funding Requirement<br>
Resourcing Requirement<br>
Risk Planning - Teams conflicts/committments, release schedules, resource availability, a product that has never been done before - what are the possible areas of failure and what are the mitigation plans<br>
Present the high level plan to Senior Leadership for thumbsup<br>
$ Approval by Finance
Resource Approval<br>
Low Level System Design Workshops between engineering/architecture<br>
Hire Squad<br>
PI Planning, Product Backlog, Sprint Planning, Spring Backlog, Demo/Retro Planning etc. Engage Engineering in Team A , Team B to build, Hire squad to build API Gateway to access susbsytems - API A and API B, Mobile App and Web App.<br>
End to End Testing<br>
Cutover Planning
Schedule Go-Live<br>
Post Production Support<br>
User Training<br>
Plan next iteration<br>

What are the possible risks and what are the mitigation plans? 

A end to end system design has to take into account overall performance issues, performance of the system depends on both the systems performing optimaly to meet SLAs. Close colloboration and communication key to succcess for the delivery of end to end solution. Defect resolution could be a challenge especially when a transaction involves two seperate system. There is a risk with the overall product failing due to underlying systems extendability and maintainability to allow for growing product requirments
